		<h2>About</h2>	
		<p>Harrison Bronfeld is progressive dreamer and a pragmatic thinker (and, eveidently, an obnoxious third person writer).</p>
		<p> I was raised in Princeton, New Jersey, and remain a proud Garden Stater and graduate of Princeton Public Schools. I am passionate about politics and organizing for political change.</p>
		<p>After high school, I took a gap year where I worked as a field organizer on the Hillary Clinton campaign. Over the course of my year I worked in 10 different states making phone calls, knocking on doors, and organizing events for Secratary Clinton. From southeast Iowa to southern New Hampshire to down town Charleston West Virginia I criss-crossed the country in support of her presidential bid.</p>
		<p>I am currently a student at Stanford University where I am studying Computer Science and Public Policy.</p>
